# Multi Armed Bandits Algorithm

## Team Members:
- Chandler
- Issac
- Kaden
- Nate Stott

## Reflection:
### What role does randomness play in helping or hindering convergence under dynamic conditions?

### How does the modified epsilon-greedy algorithm compare to the standard approach, particularly in terms of adaptability?
