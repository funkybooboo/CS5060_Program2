## Reflection:

### Part 1

#### Compare the convergence rates for each quenching strategy.



#### Analyze which quenching function provides the best balance of exploration and exploitation, and why.



### Part 2

#### Analyze the behavior of these modified strategies in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.



#### Reflect on how these modifications change the balance between exploration and exploitation.



### Part 3

#### What role does randomness play in helping or hindering convergence under dynamic conditions?



#### How does the modified epsilon-greedy algorithm compare to the standard approach, particularly in terms of adaptability?
